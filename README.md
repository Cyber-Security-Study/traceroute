Traceroute
==========



Trace the path packets take through the Internet, from MIT's servers to any website.

Uses `traceroute` to fetch IP addresses, maps those IP addresses to coordinates using GeoIP, and plots those coordinates with the Google Maps API.

Inspired by a class I took in which we made an exhibit about the Internet at the MIT Museum, “Net Works,” in spring 2013.
